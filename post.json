  "content": "**US Market.** The U.S. economic outlook is currently dominated by the ongoing government shutdown, which some warn could become the longest ever, potentially impacting crucial programs like food stamp benefits and causing widespread economic damage. Amidst this, concerns about banks' credit quality have unsettled investors, fueling a bond-market rally, even as Moody's affirms the banking system's soundness despite worries over bad loans. Separately, Fifth Third Bank issued reassurances, while its profits rose, contrasting with Comerica's slight slip. Market volatility has returned, with global markets largely down, yet gold has seen a significant surge, extending its streak and reaching new highs, driven by growing hopes for Fed rate cuts. This strong gold performance is even prompting discussions about a potential re-evaluation of the classic 60/40 stock-bond investing portfolio. On the policy front, President Trump has set new tariffs on imported trucks and buses, though extending exemptions for automakers. The Education Department has agreed to resume more student loan cancellations, aiming to ease borrower burdens, while consumers face higher Obamacare prices in several states.

Retailers are also adjusting their policies as rising costs mean free returns are no longer a given.  **IT Market.** Italy's economic outlook shows positive signs, with DBRS raising its sovereign rating to 'A' with a stable trend, a significant upgrade since 2017. The IMF echoed this, praising Italy's \"fantastic\" deficit results, although stressing the need for reforms to boost growth, which the Bank of Italy reports at a stable 0.6% with record-low unemployment. The government has approved a \"serious\" 18.7 billion euro budget, focusing on family support, salary improvements, healthcare, and enterprise. Key fiscal measures include an IRPEF tax cut for incomes between 28,000 and 200,000 euros, along with enhanced \"mother bonuses\" and parental leave. However, the controversial \"extra-profits\" or new tax measures targeting banks led to declines across Italian and European stock exchanges, with Milan being the worst performer. Concerns over the health of US regional banks and international trade tensions further contributed to European market weakness. Despite stock market turbulence, confidence in Italy's public debt remained evident, with the BTP-Bund spread closing at a low 79.7 basis points and new BTP Valore bonds offering attractive yields to small savers. Several companies presented peculiar news: EssilorLuxottica saw an impressive 12% stock surge due to strong quarterly sales, reaching a valuation of over 140 billion euros.

However, the rise of the \"non-observed\" economy to over 217 billion euros in 2023 presents a persistent challenge. Lastly, President Mattarella emphasized the societal concern over significant salary disparities, particularly between managers and employees.  **FR Market.** France's economic outlook faces headwinds as S&P downgraded its credit rating from AA to A+, prompting the Finance Minister to reiterate commitment to deficit targets. The government's 2026 budget proposal outlines a substantial €39 billion effort, equally split between new taxes and expenditure reductions. Key fiscal measures include plans to recover €15 billion from retirement pensions by 2030 through under-indexation, along with new taxes on inheritances, medical fee overruns, and small parcels originating outside the EU. Adding to retiree concerns, supplementary private pensions (Agirc-Arrco) will not be revalued this year due to a lack of agreement between social partners.
